# Floquet-Hofstadter-Hamiltonian

This repository contains functions for calculating the allowed energies of a tightly-bound electron on a square lattice subject to a transerve magnetic field in real lattice space and k-space. It also contains functions for computing the Chern number of each energy band. Functions for computing the quasienergies of the electron from an effective Floquet Hamiltonian for square wave magnetic flux switching and functions for building Hamiltonians supporting chiral edge modes (both in the static and flux switching cases) are also included. Additionally, a plotting script is included, which allows for visualizing the energies and quasienergies in various ways.
